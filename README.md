AnyThink is an app that helps you to organize your ideas into non-hierarchical visual nets.  
The idea came out of my personal frustration with traditional 'files and folders' note taking apps, proprietary formats, etc. I wanted a very easy to use, light app that would allow me to create entities of any kind (text, URL, image, PDF) and link them together in arbitrary ways similar to our natural way of associative thinking. I've tried tons of apps including The Brain, DEVONThink, etc. but nothing was satisfactory.  
It's still work in progress, please do check it out at [https://anythink.app].
